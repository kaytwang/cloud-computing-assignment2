# only three nodes cluster
# clustering couchdb nodes in:
#       ins0 "couchdb@115.146.84.191"
#       ins2 "couchdb@115.146.86.111"
#       ins3 "couchdb@115.146.86.90"

# !!there is no couchdb in ins1 "115.146.86.107"!!

# Ideally, "couchdb@127.0.0.1" should not appear in cluster_nodes, however,
# in this case, it could be ignored, them just not access couchdb through 127.0.0.1
# or localhost, at the same time, do not do any operation to couchdnb@127.0.0.1,
# just use couchdn with external ip address, as i am not sure whether
# there are some wrong inside. Using the nodes metioned(with external ip) should be fine.
# I will remove the couchdb@127.0.0.1 from cluster_nodes finally.

 # path to couchdb: /opt/couchdb

# The location of couchdb is /opt now, the data is in /opt/data. Finally, it should
# be set to /mnt, but I haven't done that successfully, but you're free to use the
# cluster node.
