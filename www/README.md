# The Web App
The project is developed to show the result of twitter data analysis, and combined with map and the income of each suburb in VIC.    

## Server 
The app is built by koa2 generator and followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, separating the controller and view logically.     

This design was implemented by Server Send Events (SSE) technology. It allows the server to send multiple message to client, after request received.
